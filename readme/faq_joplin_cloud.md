# FAQ

## What is Joplin Cloud?

[Joplin Cloud](https://joplincloud.com) allows you to synchronise your notes automatically to all your devices. Moreover, this service gives you access to additional features:

- Publish a note to the internet and share it with others. The published note will be updated automatically whenever you make a change.

- Collaborate on a notebook with other Joplin Cloud users. You can share a notebook with other users who will then have full access to it - they can read, change or add more notes, images or documents to the notebook. This is convenient to work on ideas or on a project with others.

- Improved sync performances. Compared to other sync options, Joplin Cloud, being developed specifically for Joplin, is faster and consumes less resources.

Moreover, by getting a subscription you are supporting the development of the project as a whole, including the open source applications. Such support is needed in the long term to provide bug and security fixes, add new features, and provide support.
